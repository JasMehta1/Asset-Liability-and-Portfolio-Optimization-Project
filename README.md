# Asset-Liability-and-Portfolio-Optimization-Project
Quantitative Portfolio Optimization Project

Quantitative Portfolio Optimization:

Utilized vectorized returns analysis for asset optimization.
Employed risk-adjusted measures and analyzed non-Gaussian distribution, skewness, and kurtosis.
Estimated Value at Risk (VaR) to manage downside risk.
Efficient Frontier Framework:

Implemented the Efficient Frontier with multiple assets.
Utilized Quadratic Programming Optimizer for asset allocation.
Introduced the risk-free asset to enhance portfolio performance.
Robust Risk Management:

Conducted sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of optimization models.
Explored the limitations of diversification strategies.
Simulated asset returns using Monte Carlo simulations, considering parameters like mean (mu) and volatility (sigma).
Asset-Liability Management (ALM):

Managed funding ratios and surplus optimization.
Designed liability hedging portfolios (LHP) and explored Liability-Driven Investing (LDI).
Evaluated equity portfolios for their effectiveness in liability hedging.
Technologies Used:
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Monte Carlo simulation techniques.
